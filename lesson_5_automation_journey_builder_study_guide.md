# SFMC Certification Study Guide
## Lesson 5: Automation & Journey Builder

### What You'll Learn (Like You're in 5th Grade!)

Hey there, future SFMC automation expert! 🤖 Today we're learning about automation and Journey Builder - it's like teaching your computer to be your super smart assistant that can send emails and do marketing tasks while you sleep!

Think of automation like setting up a chain of dominoes. Once you push the first domino (trigger), all the other dominoes fall in order (your automated actions). Journey Builder is like creating a choose-your-own-adventure story for your customers, where they take different paths based on what they do!

### 🤖 **What is Marketing Automation?**

**Think of automation like a helpful robot assistant!** Marketing automation is when you set up your computer to do marketing tasks automatically, without you having to do them manually every time.

**Real-Life Example:**
- When someone signs up for your newsletter, automation can automatically send them a welcome email
- Like having a doorbell that automatically plays music when someone visits your house!

**Types of Automation in SFMC:**
1. **Triggered Sends** - Emails sent when something specific happens
2. **Journey Builder** - Multi-step customer experiences  
3. **Automation Studio** - Behind-the-scenes data processing
4. **Import Activities** - Automatically bringing in new data

---

### 🛠️ **Automation Studio: Your Behind-the-Scenes Helper**

**What is Automation Studio?**
Automation Studio is like the backstage crew at a theater - you don't see them, but they make everything work smoothly by handling data, imports, and other technical tasks.

**Key Activities in Automation Studio:**
- **Import Activity** - Bringing customer data into SFMC (like uploading a class roster)
- **Query Activity** - Finding specific customers using SQL (like searching your contact list)
- **Data Copy Activity** - Moving data from one place to another
- **Filter Activity** - Creating groups of customers based on rules

**Step-by-Step: Creating a Basic Automation**
1. Go to Automation Studio
2. Click "New Automation"
3. Give it a name (like "Daily Customer Import")
4. Drag activities from the left panel to create your workflow
5. Connect activities with arrows to show the order
6. Set a schedule (daily, weekly, etc.)
7. Activate your automation

### 🗺️ **Journey Builder: Creating Customer Adventures**

**What is Journey Builder?**
Journey Builder is like creating a map for your customers' experiences. It's where you design the path customers take based on their actions and preferences.

**Think of it like a board game:**
- Customers start at "Go"
- Based on what they do (open email, click link, make purchase), they move to different spaces
- Each space has different activities (send email, wait, check conditions)

**Types of Journeys:**
1. **Single Send Journey** - One-time email blast
2. **Multi-Step Journey** - Series of emails and activities over time
3. **Event-Triggered Journey** - Starts when specific actions happen

---

### 📧 **Single Send Journey: Your Quick Email Blast**

**What is a Single Send Journey?**
A Single Send Journey is like sending one announcement to your whole class - everyone gets the same message at the same time.

**When to Use Single Send:**

- Holiday greetings

**Step-by-Step: Creating a Single Send Journey**
1. Go to Journey Builder
2. Click "Create New Journey"
3. Choose "Single Send Journey"
4. Select your audience (like picking which class gets the announcement)
5. Choose your email template
6. Set when to send (now or scheduled)

### 🛤️ **Multi-Step Journeys: The Customer Adventure Path**

**What is a Multi-Step Journey?**
A Multi-Step Journey is like a series of connected adventures. Customers move from one step to the next based on what they do or don't do.

**Journey Components:**
- **Entry Source** - How customers enter (like the starting gate)
- **Activities** - Actions taken (send email, wait, check data)
- **Decision Splits** - Where customers can take different paths

- **Exit Criteria** - When customers leave the journey

**Step-by-Step: Building a Welcome Journey**
1. **Set Entry Source** - New subscribers from a data extension
2. **Welcome Email** - Send immediately when they enter
3. **Wait Activity** - Wait 3 days
4. **Decision Split** - Did they open the welcome email?
   - If YES: Send product recommendations
   - If NO: Send different email with special offer
5. **Goal** - Make a purchase within 30 days

---

### ⚙️ **Journey Settings & Configuration**

**Journey Settings - Like Setting Up Game Rules**

**Contact Entry Settings:**
- **No re-entry** - Customers can only go through once (like a one-time ride)
- **Re-entry only after exiting** - Can go through again only after completing
- **Re-entry anytime** - Can enter multiple times

**Email Settings:**
- Choose your send classification (who emails come from)
- Set publication lists (how customers can unsubscribe)
- Configure delivery options

**Goals - Your Journey Success Metrics**
Goals are like setting a target for what you want customers to do:

- **Wait by Attribute** - Wait until customer data changes

**Best Practices for Wait Times:**

- **Educational Series**: Wait 1 week between lessons
- **Holiday Campaigns**: Wait until specific dates

---

### 🎯 **Decision Splits: Choose Your Own Adventure**

**What are Decision Splits?**
Decision Splits are like forks in the road where customers take different paths based on their behavior or information.

**Types of Decision Splits:**
1. **Engagement Split** - Based on email opens/clicks
2. **Attribute Split** - Based on customer data (age, location, preferences)
3. **Random Split** - Randomly divide customers (for A/B testing)

**Example: Email Engagement Split**
- **Path A (Opened Email)**: Send product catalog
- **Path B (Didn't Open)**: Send with different subject line
- **Path C (Clicked Link)**: Send discount offer

---

Using SQL to find customers who meet certain criteria:
```sql
SELECT CustomerID, EmailAddress, FirstName
FROM Subscribers 
WHERE OptInDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE())
```

**Filter Activity - Creating Customer Segments**
Like sorting your music by genre:
- Create rules (age > 25, location = California)
- Combine multiple conditions (age > 25 AND interested in camping)
- Save results to new data extension

---
