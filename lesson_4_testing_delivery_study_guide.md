# SFMC Certification Study Guide
## Lesson 4: Testing & Delivery

### What You'll Learn (Like You're in 5th Grade!)

Hey there, future SFMC expert! üåü Today we're learning about testing and delivering emails - it's like being a chef who tastes their food before serving it to customers, and then makes sure everyone gets their meal!

Testing emails is like checking your homework before turning it in. You want to make sure everything looks perfect and works correctly before sending it to real people. Delivery is like being a mail carrier - making sure your emails actually reach people's inboxes!

### üß™ **What is Email Testing?**

Think of email testing like being a quality inspector at a toy factory. Before toys go to stores, someone checks that they work properly, look good, and are safe. Email testing does the same thing for emails!

**Types of Email Testing:**
1. **Preview Testing** - Like looking at your drawing before showing it to the class
2. **Test Sends** - Sending practice emails to yourself and friends to check them
3. **Subscriber Preview** - Seeing how your email looks for different people
4. **A/B Testing** - Trying two different versions to see which one works better

---

### üìß **Test Sends: Your Email Practice Run**

**What is a Test Send?**
A test send is like doing a dress rehearsal before a school play. You send your email to yourself or team members to check:
- Does it look good on phones and computers?
- Do all the links work when you click them?
- Are there any spelling mistakes?
- Does the personalization work correctly?

**How to Do Test Sends:**
1. Go to your email in Content Builder
2. Click "Test Send" (like clicking "Practice Mode" in a video game)
3. Type in email addresses of people who should check it
4. Click "Send Test"
5. Check the test email and fix any problems

### üëÄ **Subscriber Preview: Seeing Through Others' Eyes**

**What is Subscriber Preview?**
This is like trying on someone else's glasses to see how they see the world! Subscriber Preview shows you how your email will look for different subscribers with different information.

**Why It's Important:**
- People have different names, so "Hello %%FirstName%%" might show "Hello Sarah" for one person and "Hello Michael" for another
- Some people might be VIP customers while others are new subscribers
- Different people might see different products or offers

**How to Use It:**
1. Click "Preview and Test" on your email
2. Select a data extension with test subscribers
3. Pick different subscriber records to see how the email changes
4. Make sure personalization works for everyone

---

### üéØ **Send Classifications: The Email's ID Card**

**What are Send Classifications?**
Think of send classifications like labels on medicine bottles - they tell you important information about what you're sending and how to handle it safely.

**What They Include:**
- **From Name** - Who the email appears to come from (like "Northern Trail Outfitters")
- **From Email** - The email address it comes from
- **Reply-To Email** - Where replies should go
- **CAN-SPAM Classification** - Whether it's promotional or informational

---

### üì¨ **Email Delivery: Getting Your Message Delivered**

**What is Email Delivery?**
Email delivery is like being a mail carrier. Your job is to make sure emails actually reach people's mailboxes (inboxes) and don't get lost or thrown away (spam folder).

**Three Types of Email Delivery:**

1. **Send Now** - Like express mail, goes out immediately
2. **Schedule for Later** - Like setting an alarm clock for your email
3. **Send Flow** - Using guided steps to send (like following a recipe)

---

### üìä **Publication Lists: Your Mailing Groups**

**What are Publication Lists?**
Think of publication lists like different clubs at school. Some students are in the Science Club, others in Art Club, and some in both! Publication lists help you organize subscribers into groups.

**Why Use Them:**
- Send newsletters only to people who want newsletters
- Send sale announcements only to people who want sales info
- Let people choose what types of emails they want to receive

**How to Create One:**
1. Go to Email Studio
2. Find "Publication Lists" 
3. Click "Create"
4. Give it a name like "Weekly Newsletter Subscribers"
5. Write a description so everyone knows what it's for

---

### üîç **Tracking: Seeing How Your Emails Perform**

**What is Email Tracking?**
Email tracking is like being a detective who investigates what happened to your emails. Did people open them? Click on links? Make purchases?

**Important Tracking Metrics:**
- **Delivered** - How many emails successfully reached inboxes
- **Opens** - How many people opened and read your email
- **Clicks** - How many people clicked on links in your email
- **Bounces** - How many emails couldn't be delivered (like mail returned to sender)

---

### üìà **Reports: Your Email Report Card**

**What are Reports?**
Reports are like report cards for your emails. They show you grades (metrics) for how well your emails performed.

**Types of Reports:**
- **Send Summary** - Overall performance of your email campaign
- **Click Activity** - Which links people clicked most
- **Bounce Report** - Which email addresses had problems
- **Unsubscribe Report** - Who decided to stop receiving emails

**How to Access Reports:**
1. Go to Email Studio
2. Click on "Tracking"
3. Find your sent email
4. Click to see detailed reports
