# SFMC Certification Study Guide
## Lesson 7: Tracking & Reporting (6-14% of Exam)

### What You'll Learn (Like You're in 5th Grade!)

Hey there, future SFMC analytics expert! üìä Today we're learning about tracking and reporting - it's like being a detective who investigates what happens after you send your emails, finding clues about how people respond and what makes them happy!

Think of email tracking like keeping score in a game. When Northern Trail Outfitters sends an email about new hiking boots, tracking tells us: Did people open the email? Did they click on the boots? Did they buy anything? It's like having a magical scoreboard that shows you exactly how well your email "game" is going and what you need to do to improve!

### üìä **What is Email Tracking & Reporting?**

**Think of tracking like having a super-smart notebook that automatically writes down everything!** Email tracking and reporting in SFMC involves monitoring, measuring, and analyzing how subscribers interact with your emails and journeys to understand performance and optimize future campaigns.

**Real-Life Example - Northern Trail Outfitters:**
- NTO sends an email about winter camping gear to 10,000 outdoor enthusiasts
- Tracking shows: 2,500 people opened it, 300 clicked on sleeping bags, 45 made purchases
- Reports reveal that customers in Colorado engaged more than those in Florida
- Analytics show that emails sent on Tuesday mornings perform 23% better
- This data helps NTO send better emails and increase sales

**Key Tracking Components:**
1. **Email Performance Metrics** - Opens, clicks, bounces, unsubscribes
2. **Conversion Tracking** - Sales, downloads, form submissions
3. **Journey Analytics** - Multi-step campaign performance
4. **Subscriber Behavior** - Individual interaction patterns
5. **Custom Reporting** - Tailored analysis for specific business needs
6. **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live campaign performance tracking

### üìà **Email Studio Tracking Fundamentals**

**Core Email Metrics:**

**1. Delivery Metrics**
- **Sent**: Total number of emails sent
- **Delivered**: Emails that reached recipient servers (Sent - Bounces)
- **Bounces**: Emails that couldn't be delivered
  - *Hard Bounces*: Permanent failures (invalid addresses)
  - *Soft Bounces*: Temporary failures (full inbox, server issues)

**2. Engagement Metrics**
- **Opens**: Number of times emails were opened
- **Unique Opens**: Number of individual subscribers who opened
- **Clicks**: Total number of link clicks
- **Unique Clicks**: Number of individual subscribers who clicked
- **Open Rate**: (Unique Opens √∑ Delivered) √ó 100
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: (Unique Clicks √∑ Delivered) √ó 100
- **Click-to-Open Rate (CTOR)**: (Unique Clicks √∑ Unique Opens) √ó 100

**3. List Health Metrics**
- **Unsubscribes**: People who opted out
- **Spam Complaints**: Recipients who marked as spam
- **Forwards**: Emails shared with others
- **Forward Opens**: Opens from forwarded emails

**Calculating Key Rates:**
```
Open Rate = (Unique Opens √∑ Delivered) √ó 100
Example: (2,500 opens √∑ 9,800 delivered) √ó 100 = 25.5%

Click-Through Rate = (Unique Clicks √∑ Delivered) √ó 100
Example: (300 clicks √∑ 9,800 delivered) √ó 100 = 3.1%

Click-to-Open Rate = (Unique Clicks √∑ Unique Opens) √ó 100
Example: (300 clicks √∑ 2,500 opens) √ó 100 = 12%
```

**Understanding Tracking Pixels:**
- **Open Tracking**: 1x1 pixel image in email HTML
- **Click Tracking**: Links redirected through SFMC servers
- **Image Blocking**: Many clients block images by default
- **Privacy Updates**: iOS Mail Privacy Protection affects open tracking

SELECT 
    s.JobID,
    COUNT(s.SubscriberID) as Sent,
    COUNT(o.SubscriberID) as Opens,
    COUNT(c.SubscriberID) as Clicks,
    (COUNT(o.SubscriberID) * 100.0 / COUNT(s.SubscriberID)) as OpenRate,
    (COUNT(c.SubscriberID) * 100.0 / COUNT(s.SubscriberID)) as ClickRate
FROM _Sent s
LEFT JOIN _Open o ON s.JobID = o.JobID AND s.SubscriberID = o.SubscriberID
LEFT JOIN _Click c ON s.JobID = c.JobID AND s.SubscriberID = c.SubscriberID

### üîß **Custom Tracking Implementation**

**Advanced Tracking Setup:**

**1. Google Analytics Integration**
```html
<!-- UTM Parameter Tracking -->
<a href="https://www.nto.com/hiking-boots?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=winter_gear&utm_content=hero_cta">
Shop Hiking Boots
</a>

<!-- Google Analytics Event Tracking -->
<a href="https://www.nto.com/hiking-boots" 
   onclick="gtag('event', 'click', {
     'event_category': 'email',
     'event_label': 'winter_gear_campaign',
     'campaign_name': 'Winter Gear 2024'
   });">
Shop Now
</a>
```

**2. Custom Conversion Tracking**
```sql
-- Track email-driven purchases
SELECT 
    c.SubscriberKey,
    c.EventDate as ClickDate,
    p.PurchaseDate,
    p.PurchaseAmount,
    DATEDIFF(hour, c.EventDate, p.PurchaseDate) as HoursToConversion
FROM _Click c
INNER JOIN Purchase_Data p ON c.SubscriberKey = p.CustomerID
WHERE c.EventDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
    AND p.PurchaseDate >= c.EventDate
    AND DATEDIFF(day, c.EventDate, p.PurchaseDate) <= 7
```

**3. Journey Attribution Tracking**
```sql
-- Multi-touch attribution analysis
SELECT 
    j.ContactKey,
    j.JourneyName,
    j.ActivityName,
    j.EventDate,
    c.URL as ClickedLink,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY j.ContactKey ORDER BY j.EventDate) as TouchPoint
FROM _JourneyActivity j
LEFT JOIN _Click c ON j.ContactKey = c.SubscriberKey 
    AND j.EventDate = c.EventDate
WHERE j.EventDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE())
```

**Revenue Attribution Models:**

**1. First-Touch Attribution**
- Credits first email interaction with full conversion value
- Good for brand awareness campaigns
- Simple but may undervalue nurturing efforts

**2. Last-Touch Attribution**
- Credits final email interaction before conversion
- Good for direct response campaigns
- May undervalue early-stage touchpoints

**3. Linear Attribution**
- Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints
- Balanced view of customer journey
- May over-credit low-impact interactions

**4. Time-Decay Attribution**
- More credit to recent interactions
- Recognizes recency bias in purchase decisions
- Complex but realistic modeling
