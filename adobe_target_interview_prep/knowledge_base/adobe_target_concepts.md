## üìä **Testing Methodologies**

### **A/B Testing Best Practices**

#### **Test Design Framework**
1. **Hypothesis Formation**
   - Clear, testable prediction
   - Based on data or user research
   - Specific success metrics defined

2. **Statistical Planning**
   - **Sample Size Calculation**: Use power analysis
   - **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest meaningful improvement
   - **Statistical Power**: Typically 80%
   - **Significance Level**: Usually 95% confidence

3. **Test Duration**
   - Minimum 1-2 weeks for business cycle coverage
   - Account for seasonality and day-of-week effects
   - Don't stop early based on significance alone

#### **Sample Size Formula**
```
n = (z‚ÇÅ‚ÇãŒ±/‚ÇÇ + z‚ÇÅ‚ÇãŒ≤)¬≤ √ó (p‚ÇÅ(1-p‚ÇÅ) + p‚ÇÇ(1-p‚ÇÇ)) / (p‚ÇÅ-p‚ÇÇ)¬≤

Where:
- z‚ÇÅ‚ÇãŒ±/‚ÇÇ = Critical value for significance level
- z‚ÇÅ‚ÇãŒ≤ = Critical value for power  
- p‚ÇÅ, p‚ÇÇ = Expected conversion rates
- n = Required sample size per variation
```

### **Multivariate Testing (MVT)**

#### **When to Use MVT**
- **High Traffic**: Need large sample sizes for statistical power
- **Multiple Elements**: Testing 3+ page elements simultaneously
- **Interaction Effects**: Understanding how elements work together

#### **MVT Considerations**
- **Factorial Growth**: 3 elements √ó 3 variations = 27 combinations
- **Sample Size**: Requires significantly more traffic than A/B tests
- **Complexity**: More difficult to analyze and interpret results

## ü§ñ **Personalization & AI Features**

### **Automated Personalization (AP)**
- Uses machine learning algorithms to deliver individualized experiences
- **Ensemble Models**: Combines multiple algorithms for better accuracy
- **Real-time Learning**: Continuously improves based on visitor behavior
- **Minimum Traffic**: Requires significant volume for algorithm training

### **Auto-Target**
- Hybrid approach combining A/B testing with personalization
- Uses visitor profiles to determine best experience for each individual
- **Learning Phase**: Initial period where algorithm gathers data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track lift vs. control experience

### **Automated Segments**
- AI-powered audience discovery
- Identifies high-performing visitor segments automatically
- **Segment Insights**: Explains why segments perform differently
- **Actionable Audiences**: Can be used for future targeting

## üìà **Analytics & Reporting**

### **Key Metrics & KPIs**

#### **Conversion Metrics**
- **Conversion Rate**: Primary success metric
- **Revenue per Visitor (RPV)**: For e-commerce optimization
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Transaction value analysis
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Long-term impact assessment

#### **Engagement Metrics**
- **Click-through Rate (CTR)**: Link/button performance
- **Time on Page**: Content engagement indicator
- **Bounce Rate**: Single-page session percentage
- **Page Views per Session**: Site exploration depth

#### **Statistical Measures**
- **Confidence Level**: Certainty in results (typically 95%)
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of likely true values
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement over control
- **Statistical Power**: Ability to detect true effects

### **Adobe Analytics Integration**

#### **Data Flow**
```
Adobe Target ‚Üí Experience Decisions ‚Üí Adobe Analytics ‚Üí Reporting
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                      ‚Üì              ‚Üì
Activity Data ‚Üí A4T Integration ‚Üí Data Processing ‚Üí Insights
```

#### **Analytics for Target (A4T)**
- **Benefits**: Unified reporting, advanced segmentation, attribution
- **Setup**: Requires proper implementation and configuration
- **Metrics**: Use Analytics metrics instead of Target's conversion counting
- **Latency**: 24-48 hour delay for complete data availability
