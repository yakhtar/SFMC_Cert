# Detailed Interview Talking Points - Solvd Adobe Target Assessment
## Comprehensive Speaking Notes with Executive Insights

---

## 📋 **Q1: What are your next steps to investigate the drop?**

### **Opening Statement & Strategic Mindset (45 seconds)**
*"When I see a 12% conversion drop over 2 months, my first reaction isn't to panic or make quick fixes. This represents potentially millions in lost revenue, but it's also a huge opportunity. At Bed Bath & Beyond, I learned that rushing to solutions without proper investigation often makes problems worse and wastes resources."*

*"My approach is like being a detective - gather evidence first, then build the case. Here's why this systematic approach works better than intuition or quick fixes:"*

**Why This Matters to Leadership:**
- *"Quick fixes often address symptoms, not root causes, leading to recurring problems"*
- *"Proper investigation prevents expensive mistakes and builds team confidence"*
- *"Data-driven decisions have higher success rates and lower risk"*

### **Phase 1: Data Deep Dive (Week 1)**

#### **Adobe Analytics Investigation (60 seconds)**
*"First, I'm diving into Adobe Analytics to segment this problem. Think of this like medical diagnosis - we need to understand exactly who, what, when, and where before we can prescribe treatment."*

**Specific Analysis Areas:**

- **Device & Platform Segmentation**: *"Is this affecting iPhone users differently than Android? Sometimes iOS updates or app store policies create unexpected friction. I'm also checking if this correlates with any recent mobile OS updates."*

- **Traffic Source Deep-Dive**: *"The social referral spike is a major clue. Social media customers have different mindsets - they're often price-comparison shopping, less brand-loyal, and expect instant gratification. I'm segmenting by Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter to see if specific platforms show different patterns."*

- **Temporal Analysis**: *"I'm creating hour-by-hour, day-by-day analysis. Did this happen gradually or suddenly? Weekend vs weekday patterns? This timing tells us if it's related to marketing campaigns, seasonal factors, or technical releases."*

- **Customer Value Segmentation**: *"Are we losing high-value customers or price-sensitive customers? New customers who don't know our brand or loyal customers who suddenly changed behavior? This determines our recovery strategy."*

**Why This Segmentation Matters:**
*"Each segment might need different solutions. Social traffic might need more trust signals, while returning customers might just need a technical fix."*

**Personal Experience Reference**: *"At BB&B, I discovered that cart abandonment was primarily affecting social traffic customers who expected different promotional structures than our traditional Google search customers. This insight led to segment-specific optimizations."*

#### **Quantum Metric Session Analysis (75 seconds)**
*"Next, I'm using Quantum Metric for qualitative insights. Think of this as watching security camera footage, but for digital behavior. Numbers tell us what happened, but session replays show us why it happened."*

**Specific Investigation Areas:**

- **Failed Checkout Journey Analysis**: *"I'm watching 100+ complete sessions from cart to abandonment. What was the customer's last action? Did they try multiple times to complete checkout? Did they get frustrated and leave immediately or browse around first?"*

- **Error Pattern Recognition**: *"Looking for technical issues customers experienced - JavaScript errors that broke the flow, payment forms that didn't respond, loading screens that took too long. These issues might not show up in our technical monitoring but are visible in customer behavior."*

- **UI Confusion Points**: *"The new progress indicator and offer code validation - are customers clicking multiple times because they don't understand the interface? Are they entering offer codes repeatedly because error messages are unclear?"*

- **Segment Behavior Differences**: *"Do social media customers interact with the checkout differently? Are they spending more time reading terms, looking for security indicators, or comparing prices in other tabs?"*

**Why Session Replays Are Critical:**
*"Data shows us conversion dropped 12%, but session replays show us the exact moment customers decide to leave. This emotional context is crucial for designing solutions."*

**Business Impact Insight:**
*"If customers are abandoning because of confusion rather than price, the solution is UX improvement, not discounting. This protects margins while fixing the real problem."*

**Personal Experience Reference**: *"At BB&B, session replays revealed that customers were getting confused by our promotional messaging sequence. They'd enter one offer code, get an error, then try different codes multiple times before giving up. The fix wasn't better offer codes - it was clearer error messaging and code validation feedback."*

#### **Technical Investigation (60 seconds)**
*"Finally, I'm conducting a comprehensive technical audit. Sometimes the most obvious answer is the right one - if a feature launched and conversion dropped, there's likely a connection."*

**Key Technical Areas:**

- **Release Impact Analysis**: *"The timing is too coincidental to ignore. The progress indicator and offer code validation launched right when problems started. I'm checking for unintended consequences - did the new features slow down the page? Create JavaScript conflicts? Confuse the user flow?"*

- **Performance Deep-Dive**: *"Mobile users are incredibly sensitive to speed. I'm measuring page load times, API response times for offer validation, and mobile app crash rates during checkout. Even a 1-second delay can cause significant abandonment."*

- **Cross-Device & Browser Testing**: *"I'm testing the new features across different iOS versions, Android versions, and device types. Sometimes features work perfectly in testing but fail on older devices that real customers use."*

- **Integration Testing**: *"Checking if the new offer code validation system properly integrates with payment processing, inventory systems, and analytics tracking. Integration failures often cause mysterious conversion drops."*

**Executive Insight - Why Technical Audits Matter:**
*"Technical issues often masquerade as user behavior problems. If we assume it's a UX issue and spend months optimizing design when it's actually a 3-second loading delay, we lose time and money while frustrating customers."*

**Risk Management Perspective:**
*"I always investigate technical causes first because they're usually the fastest and cheapest to fix. If it's a bug, we can potentially recover conversion in days rather than weeks."*

### **Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation & Strategic Thinking (Week 1-2)**

#### **From Data to Actionable Theories (75 seconds)**
*"Raw data doesn't solve problems - insights do. I'm transforming our investigation findings into testable hypotheses that can drive real business improvement."*

**Strategic Hypothesis Development Process:**

- **Correlation vs Causation Analysis**: *"If the conversion drop correlates perfectly with the offer code release, that's compelling evidence but not proof. I'm looking for additional supporting evidence - did error rates increase? Did customer service tickets spike? Did specific offer codes cause more problems than others?"*

- **Segment Impact Mapping**: *"If social traffic shows a disproportionate drop, I need to understand why. Are they more price-sensitive? Less trusting of the brand? More likely to use offer codes? This insight determines whether we need segment-specific solutions or universal improvements."*

- **Customer Journey Friction Points**: *"I'm mapping exactly where in the checkout flow customers are dropping off most frequently. Is it at offer code entry? Payment information? Final confirmation? Each point suggests different root causes and solutions."*

- **Competitive Context**: *"I'm also checking if competitors made changes that might have shifted customer expectations. Sometimes our conversion drops because the market moved, not because we broke something."*

**Why This Systematic Approach Matters:**
*"Random testing is expensive and slow. By forming data-driven hypotheses, we can prioritize the most likely solutions and test them in order of potential impact."*

**Business Strategy Insight:**
*"Each hypothesis suggests different resource investments. Technical fixes require developer time, UX improvements need design resources, and segment-specific solutions require ongoing management. Proper prioritization ensures we get maximum ROI from our optimization efforts."*

### **Phase 3: Strategic Prioritization & Resource Allocation (Week 2)**

#### **ICE Framework for Business Decision-Making (90 seconds)**
*"Now I need to make strategic decisions about resource allocation. The ICE framework - Impact, Confidence, Ease - helps me balance potential return with required investment and risk."*

**Strategic Prioritization Process:**

- **Impact Assessment**: *"I'm calculating potential business impact in dollars, not just percentages. A 3% improvement affecting 10,000 daily users generates different value than 3% affecting 1,000 users. High-value customer segments get priority even if they're smaller."*

- **Confidence Evaluation**: *"How certain am I that this hypothesis is correct? High confidence comes from multiple data sources pointing to the same conclusion - analytics showing the pattern, session replays confirming user behavior, and technical evidence supporting the theory."*

- **Implementation Ease**: *"This isn't just about technical difficulty - it's about organizational ease. A simple technical fix that requires three team approvals might be harder than a complex change with executive sponsorship."*

**Business Strategy Considerations:**

- **Quick Wins vs Long-term Gains**: *"I balance immediate revenue recovery with sustainable competitive advantages. Sometimes a quick fix buys us time to implement a better long-term solution."*

- **Risk vs Reward**: *"Each hypothesis carries implementation risk. I prioritize changes that have high upside potential with limited downside risk to current functionality."*

- **Resource Optimization**: *"I consider our team's bandwidth and expertise. It's better to execute one test perfectly than three tests poorly."*

**Executive Decision Framework:**
*"I present options with clear trade-offs: 'We can recover 50% of lost conversion in 2 weeks with option A, or 80% in 6 weeks with option B. Option A requires minimal developer time, option B needs significant UX redesign. What's our priority - speed to market or maximum impact?'"*

**Closing Statement**: *"This systematic approach ensures we're making data-driven decisions with clear business rationale. It's the same methodology that helped me optimize conversion rates at both BB&B and in financial services, consistently delivering measurable ROI while managing risk."*

## 🧪 **Q2: Design an A/B test for the new progress indicator**

### **Strategic Foundation & Business Context (60 seconds)**
*"Progress indicators might seem like a small design element, but they're actually crucial psychological tools in e-commerce. They manage customer expectations and reduce uncertainty - two major causes of abandonment."*

**Why Progress Indicators Matter to Business:**
*"Think about it from a customer psychology perspective - when someone starts checkout, they're making a commitment. If they don't know how long it will take or what's coming next, anxiety increases and they're more likely to abandon. This is especially critical for mobile users who might be shopping in distracting environments."*

**The Conversion Psychology:**
*"Every moment of uncertainty is a potential exit point. Customers abandon not just because of price, but because of cognitive load and decision fatigue. A well-designed progress indicator reduces both."*

### **Evidence-Based Test Hypothesis (75 seconds)**
*"My hypothesis is built on three pillars of evidence:"*

**1. Behavioral Psychology**: *"Customers need progress feedback and time estimation to commit to completing a multi-step process. This is called the 'goal gradient effect' - people accelerate their efforts as they approach completion, but only if they know they're getting closer."*

**2. E-commerce Best Practices**: *"At Bed Bath & Beyond, I tested progress indicators with delivery context against generic step counters. The delivery-focused versions consistently outperformed because they connected progress to value - customers weren't just completing 'step 2 of 4,' they were getting closer to receiving their purchase."*

**3. Mobile-Specific Considerations**: *"Mobile users have unique constraints - smaller screens, more distractions, often shopping in less ideal environments. They need more guidance and reassurance than desktop users."*

**Specific Hypothesis Statement:**
*"By replacing generic step indicators with time-estimated, value-focused progress messaging, we can reduce checkout abandonment by managing expectations and reinforcing purchase value, leading to a 5-8% improvement in completion rates."*

### **Strategic Control vs Treatment Design (90 seconds)**

#### **🅰️ Control Group - Current Experience Analysis**
*"The control group maintains our current experience, which has specific psychological weaknesses:"*

- **Generic Step Labeling**: *"'Step 2 of 4' tells customers where they are but not why that matters or what value they're progressing toward"*
- **No Time Context**: *"Customers don't know if this will take 30 seconds or 5 minutes, creating anxiety and potential abandonment triggers"*
- **Lack of Progress Reinforcement**: *"Basic dots don't create momentum or motivation to continue"*
- **Weak Call-to-Action**: *"'Continue' is procedural, not motivational"*

**Why This Serves as Good Control**: *"It represents our current customer experience and gives us a clear baseline for measuring improvement."*

#### **🅱️ Treatment Group - Psychologically-Optimized Experience**
*"The treatment incorporates multiple psychological principles to reduce abandonment:"*

- **Progress + Emotional Messaging**: *"'Payment Info - Almost Done!' combines location awareness with positive reinforcement and creates urgency through proximity to completion"*
- **Time Expectation Management**: *"'~2 minutes remaining' reduces anxiety by setting clear expectations and makes the commitment feel manageable"*
- **Next Step Transparency**: *"'Next: Review & Complete' eliminates uncertainty about what comes after this step"*
- **Value-Reinforced CTA**: *"'Complete Order - FREE Shipping!' reminds customers of value received and creates positive anticipation"*
- **Trust Building**: *"'Your info is encrypted & secure' addresses mobile security concerns without adding friction"*

**Design Psychology Rationale**: 
*"This design addresses the three primary psychological barriers to checkout completion: uncertainty (time estimates), anxiety (clear next steps), and value perception (benefit reinforcement). Each element works together to create momentum toward completion rather than reasons to abandon."*

**Business Impact Prediction**: 
*"Based on my BB&B experience, this combination of psychological triggers typically improves conversion by 5-8% because it transforms checkout from a process customers endure into a progress they want to complete."*

### **Strategic Success Metrics Framework (90 seconds)**

#### **Primary Business Metric - Revenue Impact Focus**
- **Checkout Completion Rate**: *"This is our North Star metric - the percentage of users who start checkout and complete their purchase. But I'm not just measuring percentage improvement; I'm calculating dollar impact. A 5% improvement in completion rate translates to specific daily revenue recovery that we can track and report to leadership."*

**Why This Metric Matters Most**: *"This directly addresses our business crisis and provides clear ROI measurement for the optimization investment."*

#### **Secondary Metrics - Understanding User Behavior**
- **Time in Checkout Flow**: *"Are users moving through faster, indicating less confusion, or slower, suggesting they're more engaged with the improved messaging? Context matters - sometimes good design makes users take slightly more time because they're reading trust signals."*

- **Step-by-Step Conversion Rates**: *"I'm measuring conversion at each individual step to understand exactly where the improvement occurs. This tells us which elements of our treatment are most effective."*

- **Checkout Initiation Rate**: *"Are more people starting the checkout process because the improved progress indicator reduces anxiety about the commitment? This shows if our changes have benefits beyond completion."*

- **Repeat Purchase Behavior**: *"Do customers who experience the better progress indicator have higher repeat purchase rates? This measures long-term customer experience impact."*

#### **Guardrail Metrics - Risk Management**
- **Technical Performance**: *"Page load times, mobile app crash rates, JavaScript error rates. We cannot improve conversion at the expense of app stability - that would create bigger problems."*

- **Customer Support Impact**: *"Any increase in checkout-related support tickets, confusion reports, or negative feedback. Sometimes 'improvements' create unexpected user confusion."*

- **Revenue Per Transaction**: *"Ensuring that improved completion rates aren't coming from lower-value transactions. We want quality conversions, not just quantity."*

**Executive Insight - Metrics Strategy**: 
*"I'm designing this measurement framework to provide both immediate tactical feedback and long-term strategic insights. The primary metric gives us quick success/failure signals, secondary metrics help us understand why it worked, and guardrails protect us from unintended consequences."*

### **Strategic Test Parameters & Risk Management (120 seconds)**

#### **Intelligent Targeting Strategy**
*"Targeting isn't just about who sees the test - it's about ensuring valid, actionable results:"*

- **Device Specificity**: *"Mobile app users only, but I'm segmenting iOS vs Android in analysis because they often behave differently due to platform design conventions and user expectations."*

- **Geographic Considerations**: *"All regions, but I'm monitoring for cultural differences in progress indicator interpretation. What feels reassuring in one market might feel pushy in another."*

- **User Behavior Segmentation**: *"Both new and returning customers, but analyzing separately. New customers might need more guidance, while returning customers might prefer efficiency. This insight will inform future personalization strategies."*

- **Strategic Exclusions**: *"QA testers, employees, and users with technical issues, but also excluding users who've had recent customer service interactions about checkout problems - they might have different expectations that could skew results."*

#### **Sample Size - Business vs Statistical Considerations**
*"I need 8,500 users per variation (17,000 total), but this isn't just about statistical significance - it's about business confidence:"*

**Statistical Foundation**: 
- **Current Performance**: *"44% baseline conversion rate"*
- **Minimum Detectable Effect**: *"5% relative improvement - this represents meaningful revenue impact, not just statistical noise"*
- **Power & Confidence**: *"80% power at 95% confidence gives us strong evidence for decision-making"*

**Business Rationale**: 
*"This sample size ensures we can detect improvements that actually matter to the business. Smaller sample sizes might miss a 3% improvement that equals $50,000 monthly revenue. Larger samples delay decision-making and miss market opportunities."*

**Risk Management**: 
*"If early results show negative trends, we have statistical stopping rules to minimize customer impact while maintaining test validity."*

#### **Strategic Test Duration & Market Timing**
*"14-day duration balances statistical needs with business urgency:"*

- **Behavioral Cycle Capture**: *"Two full weeks capture weekend vs weekday shopping patterns, paycheck cycles, and different user contexts that affect checkout behavior."*

- **External Factor Management**: *"Avoiding major holidays, competitor promotional periods, and internal marketing campaigns that could confuse attribution."*

- **Traffic & Seasonality**: *"Based on current mobile app traffic patterns, we'll reach statistical significance in this timeframe while avoiding seasonal distortions."*

**Executive Decision Framework**: 
*"If we need results faster for business reasons, I can recommend interim analysis points, but early decisions carry higher risk of false conclusions. The 14-day timeframe balances confidence with speed to market."*

### **Implementation Strategy & Cross-Functional Collaboration (60 seconds)**

#### **Adobe Target Technical Implementation**
*"Using Adobe Target's Visual Experience Composer, but with strategic considerations for enterprise deployment:"*

- **Traffic Allocation**: *"50/50 split with sticky bucketing ensures users have consistent experiences across sessions, which is crucial for checkout flow integrity."*

- **Analytics Integration**: *"Analytics for Target (A4T) integration provides unified reporting and ensures our measurement aligns with broader business metrics."*

- **Quality Assurance Protocol**: *"Testing across all supported iOS and Android versions, different device sizes, and various network conditions to ensure the experience works for all customer segments."*

#### **Cross-Functional Collaboration Approach**
*"Based on my BB&B experience working with multiple teams:"*

- **UX Designer Partnership**: *"Providing detailed wireframes and user experience rationale to ensure design implementation matches psychological intent."*

- **Developer Handoff**: *"Clear technical specifications for Adobe Target implementation, including fallback scenarios if the platform fails to load."*

- **Stakeholder Communication**: *"Regular updates with business-friendly metrics and clear success/failure criteria to maintain alignment and support."*

**Risk Mitigation Strategy**: 
*"Built-in rollback capability if negative results emerge, and monitoring protocols to catch technical issues before they impact significant user volumes."*

**Closing Statement**: *"This test design balances statistical rigor with business practicality and operational feasibility. It's designed to detect meaningful improvements while minimizing risk to the customer experience and maintaining team confidence in our optimization process."*

## 💡 **Q3: Propose 3 hypotheses for optimization and prioritize them**

### **Strategic Hypothesis Development Framework (60 seconds)**
*"Developing optimization hypotheses isn't guesswork - it's strategic problem-solving based on data patterns, customer psychology, and business intelligence. I've identified three primary hypotheses that address different potential root causes of our 12% conversion drop."*

**My Hypothesis Development Process:**
*"I'm using a combination of data analysis, behavioral psychology, and e-commerce best practices to ensure each hypothesis is both testable and actionable. Each hypothesis targets a different potential cause, allowing us to test multiple solutions systematically."*

**Strategic Prioritization Philosophy:**
*"I'm using the ICE framework - Impact, Confidence, and Ease - but with business context. This isn't just about what's technically possible, but what will deliver the fastest ROI while building toward long-term competitive advantages."*

### **🔥 HYPOTHESIS 1: Offer Code Validation Friction (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

#### **Strategic Theory & Customer Psychology (75 seconds)**
*"The new offer code validation system is creating a psychological and functional barrier in the checkout flow. This isn't just about technical errors - it's about customer expectation management and trust."*

**The Customer Psychology Problem:**
*"When customers enter an offer code, they have an expectation of immediate validation and reward. If the system is slow, shows confusing error messages, or creates uncertainty about whether the code worked, it breaks the psychological momentum toward purchase completion."*

**The Business Impact Mechanism:**
*"Offer codes are often the tipping point for purchase decisions. Customers who seek discounts are typically more price-sensitive and have lower purchase intent. Any friction in the promotional flow disproportionately affects conversion because these customers have more alternatives and less brand loyalty."*

#### **Comprehensive Evidence Analysis (90 seconds)**
*"This hypothesis is supported by multiple data points and behavioral patterns:"*

**Temporal Evidence:**
- **Perfect Timing Correlation**: *"The conversion drop started within days of the offer code validation release - this level of timing precision rarely occurs by coincidence"*
- **Sustained Impact**: *"The drop has persisted for 2 months, suggesting an ongoing systematic issue rather than a temporary glitch"*

**Customer Behavior Evidence:**
- **Social Traffic Amplification**: *"Social media customers use promotional codes 3x more frequently than search traffic, and we've seen a 40% spike in social referrals during this period"*
- **Seasonal Context**: *"This occurred during a period when promotional activity typically increases, magnifying the impact"*

**E-commerce Pattern Recognition:**
- **BB&B Experience**: *"At Bed Bath & Beyond, I witnessed a similar 15% conversion drop when we modified our coupon validation system. The issue wasn't functionality - it was user experience and expectation management"*
- **Industry Best Practices**: *"Promotional flow disruption is the #1 cause of sudden conversion drops in e-commerce because it affects the most price-sensitive customers first"*

#### **Detailed ICE Score Analysis (60 seconds)**
**Impact Assessment (9/10):**
*"Potentially affects 100% of customers who attempt to use offers, which based on social traffic patterns could be 30-40% of mobile checkout attempts. Revenue recovery potential: $X daily based on current traffic volume."*

**Confidence Level (9/10):**
*"Multiple converging evidence streams: timing correlation, customer behavior patterns, technical release correlation, and alignment with known e-commerce failure modes. This is as close to certain as we can get without direct testing."*

**Implementation Ease (10/10):**
*"Can be diagnosed within hours through session replay analysis and potentially fixed through configuration changes rather than development work. If it's a UI/UX issue, we can A/B test solutions immediately."*

**Strategic Priority Justification:**
*"This hypothesis offers the highest probability of immediate revenue recovery with minimal resource investment, while building team confidence in our optimization process."*

#### **Expected Business Outcome (30 seconds)**
*"If confirmed and resolved, this could recover 4-6% of lost conversion within 1-2 weeks, representing $X-$Y in immediate revenue recovery. More importantly, it would validate our systematic approach and provide insights for preventing similar issues in future releases."*

### **📱 HYPOTHESIS 2: Mobile CTA Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### **The Theory (30 seconds)**
*"The checkout completion button needs mobile-specific optimization with urgency messaging and value proposition emphasis."*

#### **Supporting Evidence (45 seconds)**
*"Evidence supporting this hypothesis:"*
- **Mobile-Specific Drop**: *"The problem is isolated to mobile app, suggesting mobile UX issues"*
- **E-commerce Experience**: *"At BB&B, I implemented urgency-driven CTAs like 'Get it now before it sells out' with significant success"*
- **Financial Services Learning**: *"My financial services experience showed that mobile users need different CTA language than desktop users"*
- **Industry Best Practices**: *"Mobile users have shorter attention spans and need clearer value propositions"*

#### **ICE Score Breakdown (30 seconds)**
- **Impact (8/10)**: *"Mobile-specific improvement could significantly boost overall conversion"*
- **Confidence (8/10)**: *"Based on successful implementations in previous roles"*
- **Ease (8/10)**: *"Relatively straightforward A/B test implementation"*
- **Total ICE Score: 8.0/10**

#### **Expected Impact (15 seconds)**
*"Could deliver 5-8% conversion improvement specifically for mobile users."*

### **🛡️ HYPOTHESIS 3: Trust Signal Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### **The Theory (30 seconds)**
*"Social media traffic needs additional credibility signals and trust elements at the checkout decision point to overcome unfamiliarity with the brand."*

#### **Supporting Evidence (45 seconds)**
*"Supporting this hypothesis:"*
- **Social Traffic Correlation**: *"The spike in social referrals correlates with the conversion drop"*
- **User Behavior Difference**: *"Social media customers are often less familiar with brands and need more reassurance"*
- **E-commerce Success**: *"At BB&B, I implemented 'customers also bought' elements and trust badges that improved both conversion and average order value"*
- **Trust Gap**: *"Social users may be more price-comparison focused and skeptical"*

#### **ICE Score Breakdown (30 seconds)**
- **Impact (7/10)**: *"Affects specific segment but could improve both conversion and AOV"*
- **Confidence (7/10)**: *"Based on successful trust signal implementations"*
- **Ease (8/10)**: *"Can leverage existing customer data and review systems"*
- **Total ICE Score: 7.2/10**

#### **Expected Impact (15 seconds)**
*"3-5% improvement for social segment, plus potential AOV benefits."*

### **Prioritization Strategy (30 seconds)**
*"My implementation approach:"*
1. **Week 1-2**: *"Quick fix for offer code issues while building the CTA optimization test"*
2. **Week 3-4**: *"Launch mobile CTA A/B test"*
3. **Week 5-6**: *"Implement trust signal enhancements for social traffic"*
4. **Week 7-8**: *"Combine successful elements in a comprehensive optimization"*

**Closing Statement**: *"This prioritization balances quick wins with strategic improvements, ensuring we recover revenue quickly while building long-term competitive advantages."*
