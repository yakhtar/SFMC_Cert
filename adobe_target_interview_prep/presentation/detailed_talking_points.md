# Adobe Target Case Study - Detailed Talking Points
## Simple Language for All Stakeholders

---

## **SLIDE 1: Title & Problem Overview**

### **Opening Statement (30 seconds)**
*"Good morning everyone. Today I'm presenting our strategy to solve a critical business problem - our mobile app checkout conversion has dropped 12% in just two months. This means we're losing real revenue every day, but it also represents a huge opportunity to not just recover, but improve beyond where we were."*

### **Key Numbers to Emphasize**
- **12% Drop**: *"This isn't a small blip - it's a significant revenue impact"*
- **44% vs 56%**: *"We went from more than half our customers completing checkout to less than half"*
- **2 Month Timeline**: *"This is recent and urgent, but gives us clear before/after data to work with"*

### **Stakeholder Connection**
*"For our executives: This translates to real dollars lost daily. For our product team: We have clear data showing exactly where customers are dropping off. For our engineering team: We have specific areas to focus our optimization efforts."*

---

## **SLIDE 2: Investigation Strategy - What We'll Do First**

### **Simple Problem Explanation (45 seconds)**
*"Think of our checkout like a funnel. Customers are still adding items to cart (92% - that's healthy). They're still starting checkout (70% - also good). But something is breaking at the final step - completing their purchase."*

### **Our Detective Work - Phase by Phase**

#### **Week 1: Gather the Evidence**
*"Like detectives, we need to collect clues before jumping to conclusions:"*

1. **Adobe Analytics Deep Dive**
   - *"We'll segment our data to see: Are iPhone users different from Android? Are social media customers behaving differently than Google search customers?"*
   - *"We'll look at timing: Did the drop happen gradually or suddenly? On which specific days?"*

2. **Quantum Metric Session Replays**
   - *"This is like watching security camera footage - we can literally see what customers are doing when they abandon checkout"*
   - *"We'll watch 100+ failed checkout sessions to spot patterns"*

3. **Technical Investigation**  
   - *"We'll check if our recent releases (progress indicator and offer code validation) are causing problems"*
   - *"Are pages loading slower? Are there error messages customers are seeing?"*

### **Why This Methodical Approach Matters**
*"We could guess and make changes immediately, but that's risky. Wrong changes could make things worse. This investigation ensures we're fixing the real problem, not just symptoms."*

---

## **SLIDE 3: Our Top 3 Theories (Hypotheses)**

### **Introduction to Hypotheses (30 seconds)**
*"Based on our data, here are the three most likely causes of our problem, ranked by how confident we are and how big the impact could be:"*

### **üî• HYPOTHESIS 1: Offer Code Problems (Highest Priority)**

#### **The Theory in Simple Terms**
*"We recently added a new feature that validates offer codes. Our theory: this new system is either confusing customers or showing error messages that make them give up."*

#### **Why We Think This**
- *"Timing matches perfectly - the feature launched right when our problems started"*
- *"Social media customers use more promo codes, and we're seeing more social traffic"*
- *"Common pattern: new features often have unexpected side effects"*

#### **Potential Impact**
*"If we're right, fixing this could recover 3-5% of our lost conversion immediately"*

#### **ICE Score Explanation**
- **Impact (9/10)**: *"High revenue recovery potential"*
- **Confidence (9/10)**: *"Strong evidence pointing to this"*  
- **Ease (10/10)**: *"We can test and fix this quickly"*

### **üì± HYPOTHESIS 2: Social Traffic Experience Gap (High Priority)**

#### **The Theory**
*"Social media customers come with different expectations than Google search customers. They might need a different checkout experience."*

#### **The Evidence**
*"We've seen a big spike in social referrals, and these customers might be more price-sensitive or less familiar with our brand"*

#### **Potential Solution**
*"Create a specialized checkout flow for social media customers - maybe with more trust signals or different messaging"*

### **üîß HYPOTHESIS 3: Mobile Complexity Overload (Medium Priority)**

#### **The Theory**
*"Our mobile checkout might be too complicated. Customers are getting overwhelmed and giving up."*

#### **What This Means**
*"Too many steps, too much information on small screens, or unclear what to do next"*

### **Prioritization Strategy**
*"We'll start with the quick win (offer code fix) while preparing the more complex tests. This way we can potentially recover some revenue immediately while building toward bigger improvements."*

---

## **SLIDE 4: A/B Test Design - Progress Indicator Test**

### **What is an A/B Test? (Simple Explanation)**
*"An A/B test is like flipping a coin, but instead of heads/tails, we show half our customers the old experience (A) and half the new experience (B). Then we measure which group converts better."*

### **Our Specific Test Design**

#### **The Problem We're Testing**
*"We think our current progress indicator might be confusing customers about how long checkout will take or where they are in the process."*

#### **üÖ∞Ô∏è CONTROL (Current Experience)**
*"Group A sees what we have now:"*
- *"The existing progress bar"*
- *"Generic step names like 'Step 2 of 4'"*
- *"No time estimates"*
- *"Standard visual design"*

#### **üÖ±Ô∏è TREATMENT (New Experience)**  
*"Group B sees our improved version:"*
- *"Cleaner, simpler progress visualization"*
- *"Clear step names: 'Payment Info' instead of 'Step 2'"*
- *"Time estimate: '~2 minutes remaining'"*
- *"Encouraging language: 'Almost done!'"*

### **Success Metrics (How We'll Measure)**
- **Primary**: *"Checkout completion rate - did more people finish?"*
- **Secondary**: *"Time spent on checkout pages - are people moving faster?"*
- **Guardrail**: *"Overall app crashes - we must not break anything else"*

### **Test Parameters**
- **Sample Size**: *"8,500 customers per group (17,000 total)"*
- **Why This Number**: *"Large enough to detect a 5% improvement with 95% confidence"*
- **Duration**: *"14 days to capture weekend vs weekday behavior"*
- **Confidence Level**: *"95% - industry standard for business decisions"*

### **Expected Outcome**
*"If successful, we expect to improve checkout completion from 44% to 46.2% - recovering part of our lost conversion."*

---

## **SLIDE 5: Multivariate Testing - Testing Multiple Things at Once**

### **What is Multivariate Testing? (Very Simple Explanation)**
*"Instead of testing just one change (A/B), multivariate testing lets us test multiple changes simultaneously. It's like testing 4 different recipes at once to find the best combination of ingredients."*

### **Why Use Multivariate Testing Here?**
*"We have multiple elements that might be causing problems. Rather than test them one by one over months, we can test them together and see how they interact."*

### **Our 4 Test Elements**

#### **Element 1: Progress Indicator**
- **Variation A**: Current version
- **Variation B**: Simplified design  
- **Variation C**: With time estimates

#### **Element 2: Payment Form Layout**
- **Variation A**: Current multi-step approach
- **Variation B**: Everything on one page
- **Variation C**: Progressive disclosure (shows fields as needed)

#### **Element 3: Call-to-Action Button**
- **Variation A**: "Complete Purchase"
- **Variation B**: "Secure Checkout" 
- **Variation C**: "Buy Now - Free Shipping"

#### **Element 4: Trust Signals**
- **Variation A**: Current security badges
- **Variation B**: Enhanced security messaging
- **Variation C**: Customer testimonials

### **The Math (Simplified)**
*"Normally this would create 81 possible combinations (3√ó3√ó3√ó3). But we're strategically testing only 12 combinations that make business sense."*

### **Sample Size Requirements**
- **15,000 users per combination**
- **Total test population**: 180,000 users
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks for full results

### **Adobe Target Implementation**
*"Adobe Target's multivariate testing engine will automatically distribute traffic and track all interactions between elements."*

### **Expected Benefits**
*"This approach helps us find the optimal combination of elements, potentially achieving 8-12% improvement rather than just 3-5% from individual tests."*
