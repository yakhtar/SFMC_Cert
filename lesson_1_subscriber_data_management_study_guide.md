# SFMC Certification Study Guide
## Lesson 1: Subscriber & Data Management (26-29% of Exam)

### What You'll Learn (Like You're in 5th Grade!)

Hey there, future SFMC data expert! üìä Today we're learning about subscriber and data management - it's like being the librarian of a HUGE digital library where you organize, store, and find information about all your customers!

Think of subscriber data management like organizing your Pokemon cards. You need to sort them, keep track of which ones you have, update information when you get new cards, and make sure you can quickly find the exact card you're looking for when you need it!

### üìä **What is Subscriber & Data Management?**

**Think of data management like being a digital filing cabinet organizer!** Subscriber and data management is how you collect, store, organize, and use information about your customers in SFMC.

**Real-Life Example:**
- Your customer Sarah bought hiking boots last month
- You store this information: Name=Sarah, Email=sarah@email.com, LastPurchase=Hiking Boots, Date=June 2024
- Now you can send Sarah information about hiking gear because you KNOW she's interested!

**Key Components:**
1. **Contact Builder** - Your main customer database (like a digital address book)
2. **Data Extensions** - Tables that store specific customer information
3. **Import Activities** - Ways to bring customer data into SFMC
4. **Data Filters** - Tools to find specific groups of customers
5. **Query Activities** - Advanced customer searches using SQL

SELECT 
    EmailAddress,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    TotalSpent
FROM VIP_Customers 
WHERE TotalSpent > 1000 
    AND LastPurchaseDate >= DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE())
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
```

**Query Activity Components:**
