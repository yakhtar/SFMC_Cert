# SFMC Certification Study Guide
## Lesson 2: Marketing Automation (19-26% of Exam)

### What You'll Learn (Like You're in 5th Grade!)

Hey there, future SFMC automation wizard! ü§ñ Today we're diving deep into marketing automation - it's like teaching your computer to be your super-smart marketing assistant that works 24/7, even while you sleep!

Think of marketing automation like setting up a chain reaction of helpful actions. When someone does something (like signing up for your newsletter), your automation system automatically does a bunch of helpful things in response (sends welcome email, adds them to the right lists, schedules follow-up messages). It's like having dominoes that fall in exactly the right order every single time!

### ü§ñ **What is Marketing Automation?**

**Think of automation like having a tireless robot helper!** Marketing automation uses technology to automatically execute marketing tasks, send targeted messages, and nurture customer relationships without constant manual intervention.

**Real-Life Example:**
- Customer abandons their shopping cart with hiking boots
- Automation automatically waits 1 hour, then sends "Don't forget your boots!" email
- If they don't buy, waits 24 hours and sends discount offer
- If they still don't buy, waits 3 days and sends customer reviews
- All of this happens automatically while you focus on other tasks!

**Key Automation Components:**
1. **Triggers** - Events that start automation (like new subscriber, purchase, email click)
2. **Actions** - What happens automatically (send email, update data, move to list)
3. **Rules** - Conditions that determine which actions to take
4. **Timing** - When each action should happen
5. **Goals** - What you want customers to achieve
