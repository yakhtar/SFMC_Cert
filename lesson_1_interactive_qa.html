            {
                question: "When setting up a new Marketing Cloud account for NTO, what is the first critical step that must be completed before any email campaigns can be sent?",
                options: [
                    "Configure Email Studio and create email templates",
                    "Complete the Trust Site configuration and domain verification",
                    "Import contact data into Contact Builder",
                    "Create Journey Builder automated campaigns"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. The Trust Site configuration and domain verification is the foundational first step when setting up Marketing Cloud. This establishes the security framework, verifies domain ownership, and enables sender authentication before other Marketing Cloud applications can be properly configured and used."
            },

            {
                question: "NTO wants to ensure their Marketing Cloud instance meets security requirements. What is the primary purpose of configuring the Trust Site in Marketing Cloud?",
                options: [
                    "To enable email personalization features",
                    "To establish sender authentication (SPF, DKIM) and domain verification for email deliverability",
                    "To connect with Salesforce CRM data",
                    "To enable Journey Builder automation"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. The Trust Site configuration establishes sender authentication (SPF, DKIM) and domain verification, which are critical for email deliverability and security. This prevents emails from being marked as spam and establishes trust with email providers."
            },

            {
                question: "During domain verification setup, NTO's IT team asks about the DNS records required. Which DNS records are typically required for Marketing Cloud Trust Site configuration?",
                options: [
                    "Only CNAME records for tracking domains",
                    "SPF, DKIM, and CNAME records for complete sender authentication and tracking",
                    "Only MX records for email routing",
                    "A records and AAAA records only"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Complete Trust Site configuration requires SPF records for sender verification, DKIM records for message authentication, and CNAME records for tracking domains. This comprehensive setup ensures optimal deliverability and security."
            },

            {
                question: "NTO has multiple subdomains for different business units. How should they approach Trust Site configuration for optimal deliverability across all subdomains?",
                options: [
                    "Configure only the main domain and use it for all sends",
                    "Set up separate Trust Site configurations for each subdomain to maintain brand integrity",
                    "Use generic Marketing Cloud domains without custom configuration",
                    "Configure Trust Site only for the highest volume subdomain"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Setting up separate Trust Site configurations for each subdomain maintains brand integrity, improves deliverability reputation per business unit, and ensures proper sender authentication for each brand. This approach supports multi-brand strategies effectively."
            },

            {
                question: "After completing Trust Site configuration, NTO notices delivery issues. What is the most likely cause and solution for newly configured Trust Sites experiencing deliverability problems?",
                options: [
                    "DNS propagation delays - wait 24-48 hours for global DNS updates",
                    "Incorrect email content - modify subject lines",
                    "Missing contact preferences - update subscriber data",
                    "Journey Builder configuration errors - rebuild automations"
                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: A. DNS propagation delays are common after Trust Site configuration changes. DNS updates can take 24-48 hours to propagate globally, during which deliverability may be impacted. Patience and monitoring are required during this period."
            },

            // User Management, Roles & Permissions (Questions 6-10)
            {
                question: "A new Marketing Cloud user needs to understand user roles and permissions. What is the best practice for managing user access in Marketing Cloud?",
                options: [
                    "Give all users administrator access for simplicity",
                    "Assign role-based permissions based on job responsibilities and principle of least privilege",
                    "Create custom roles for each individual user",
                    "Use only default system roles without customization"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Role-based permissions following the principle of least privilege ensure users have access only to the features and data they need for their job responsibilities. This improves security and prevents accidental changes to critical configurations."
            },

            {
                question: "NTO wants to grant different access levels to their marketing team. What is the difference between 'Marketing Cloud Administrator' and 'Marketing Cloud Viewer' roles?",
                options: [
                    "Both roles have identical access permissions",
                    "Administrator has full system access including user management, while Viewer has read-only access to campaigns and data",
                    "Viewer can create campaigns but not send them, Administrator can do both",
                    "Administrator only manages users, Viewer manages campaigns"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Marketing Cloud Administrator has comprehensive access including user management, system configuration, and all campaign functions. Marketing Cloud Viewer has read-only access to view campaigns, reports, and data without modification capabilities."
            },

            {
                question: "NTO needs to create a custom role for their email designers who should only access Email Studio and Content Builder. What approach should they take?",
                options: [
                    "Use the default Content Creator role without modifications",
                    "Create a custom role with Email Studio and Content Builder permissions while restricting administrative functions",
                    "Assign Marketing Cloud Administrator role with restrictions",
                    "Give users individual application access without role assignments"
                ],
                correct: 1,

                question: "A marketing administrator needs to understand Marketing Cloud's data architecture. What is the relationship between Contact Builder and other Marketing Cloud applications?",
                options: [
                    "Contact Builder works independently from other applications",
                    "Contact Builder serves as the central data foundation that other applications reference for subscriber information",
                    "Contact Builder only stores email addresses",
                    "Other applications don't use Contact Builder data"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Contact Builder serves as the central data foundation for Marketing Cloud. All other applications (Email Studio, Journey Builder, Mobile Studio, etc.) reference Contact Builder for subscriber information, ensuring data consistency across campaigns."
            },

            {
                question: "NTO wants to understand how data flows between Marketing Cloud applications. When a subscriber updates their preferences in a Preference Center, how does this change propagate through the Marketing Cloud ecosystem?",
                options: [
                    "Changes only affect Email Studio",
                    "Preference changes update Contact Builder attributes which are then reflected in all applications that reference subscriber data",
                    "Each application maintains separate preference data",
                    "Preference changes must be manually updated in each application"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Preference changes update Contact Builder attributes (the central data repository), which automatically propagates to all applications that reference subscriber data. This ensures consistent subscriber experience across all touchpoints and campaigns."

            // Security Requirements & Operational Efficiency (Question 35)
            {
                question: "NTO's IT security team requires comprehensive security measures for their Marketing Cloud implementation. Which combination of security features provides the most robust protection for Marketing Cloud data and operations?",
                options: [
                    "Strong passwords only",
                    "Multi-factor authentication, IP allowlisting, role-based permissions with principle of least privilege, regular audit trail reviews, and secure API access management",
                    "Basic user authentication without additional security",

Comprehensive Marketing Cloud security requires multi-factor authentication, IP allowlisting for controlled access, role-based permissions with least privilege principles, regular audit trail monitoring, and secure API access management. This layered security approach protects against various threat vectors and ensures compliance with enterprise security requirements."
