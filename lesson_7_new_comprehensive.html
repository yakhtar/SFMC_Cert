                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Correct Answer: B. Enterprise SQL optimization requires strategic indexing on frequently queried columns, JOIN order optimization starting with the smallest result set, selective column retrieval (avoiding SELECT *), and execution plan analysis to identify bottlenecks. This approach ensures optimal performance with large datasets while maintaining query accuracy and system responsiveness."

Window functions provide powerful analytical capabilities: RANK() and ROW_NUMBER() for customer rankings, LAG()/LEAD() for period-over-period comparisons, NTILE() for percentile distributions, and moving averages with frame specifications. Proper partitioning and ordering ensure accurate calculations across customer segments while maintaining query performance."
